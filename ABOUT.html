<h2>About NEOlyzer</h2>

<p style="color: #666; font-style: italic;">19 January 2026</p>

<p>NEOlyzer is a standalone visualization tool for the catalog of known near-Earth asteroids (NEOs).
It was developed by <b>Rob Seaman</b> of the <a href="https://catalina.lpl.arizona.edu">Catalina Sky Survey</a>
with coding by the <b>Claude AI</b> from Anthropic. Architectural choices were generally suggested
by Claude and confirmed by Rob. NEO resource choices, the other way around.</p>

<p>NEOlyzer is available from:</p>

<p>The source code and various text files provide context related to this project and its use of
AI coding practices, in particular the many dependencies on third-party Python software packages.
Claude and I thank two of these projects in particular:
<a href="https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/">Skyfield</a>, which has indeed proven to provide "Elegant
Astronomy for Python", and the absolutely fundamental importance to our community of the planetary
ephemerides from NASA's <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/orbits.html">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>.</p>

<p>If you are new to the NEO community, NASA's
<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-defense/">Planetary Defense Coordination Office"</a> (PDCO)
is the place to start your journey.</p>

<p>AI coding tools are much more capable in 2026 than they were the last time I checked in on
the options in 2023. <a href="https://claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a> was used for this
project with a $100/month subscription. You are encouraged to investigate what the competing
AI companies offer, and perhaps more complicated IDE-based tools from third party vendors
that are growing like weeds. Let the buyer beware!</p>

<p>The regular Claude Chat interface was more than sufficient to get to the stage of a
"Minimum Viable Product" (MVP), the goal of "vibe coding" in 2025. I would not be
surprised if vibe coding as a concept becomes pass&eacute; in 2026. All I can say is that this
experienced but world-weary programmer found the AI coding paradigm to be very productive,
and the MVP version of NEOlyzer was reached long before two weeks had elapsed, which is
how long it has been from my first prompt to the AI to writing this text.</p>

<p>Note that NEOlyzer itself makes no use of AI or machine learning techniques. It is a capable
plotting layer with many options of map projection, coordinates, source filtering, etc., on
top of a database deriving from <a href="https://minorplanetcenter.net/iau/MPCORB/NEA.txt">NEA.txt</a>
from the <a href="https://minorplanetcenter.net">MPC</a>, MOIDs fetched from the
<a href="https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/sbdb.html">JPL SBDB API</a>, and discovery circumstances
by a bespoke <a href="https://sbnmpc.astro.umd.edu/MPC_database/replication-info.shtml">PostgreSQL query</a>
from the <a href="https://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu">PDS SBN</a>, Caching of sky coordinates
supports a trade-off between the number of NEOs plotted and the speed of rendering during
animation.</p>

<p>The database is as important as the mapping. I welcome feature suggestions and
error reports related to both.</p>
